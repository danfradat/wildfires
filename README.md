# wildfires

A data analysis project using python code and tableau to analyse wildfire data in Europe

Objective

Uncover more information about wildfires in 3 countries: France, Germany and Greece, then take a closer look at one (Germany). Perform an initial data and exploratory analysis in order to derive insights regarding the occurrence of wildfires since the year 2000. 
Using data from NASA. Identify wildfires locations in France, Germany and Greece. Find which countries, if any, have an upward trend. See whether any increasing trends show patterns of increasing fire intensity, or geographic location spread.
